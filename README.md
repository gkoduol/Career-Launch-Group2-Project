# Career-Launch-Group2-Project

Group 2 Career Launch project: a group restaurant recommendation web app that helps friends pick a place to eat using real Yelp data and group ratings. Users can create/join a group, browse restaurant options, submit 1–5 ratings in a card-style interface, and get a “best match” recommendation based on overall compatibility across the group.

To try it:
1. Clone the Repo

2. Install dependencies on the backend folder:
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Exit backend folder go to frontend folder and install frontend dependencies:
cd ..
cd frontend

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

4. Run Everything
bash dev-all.sh (note if dev-all.sh file in CLRF and running it doesn't work switch to LF)
