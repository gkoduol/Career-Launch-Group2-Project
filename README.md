# Career-Launch-Group2-Project

Group 2 Career Launch project: a group restaurant recommendation web app that helps friends pick a place to eat using real Yelp data and group ratings. Users can create/join a group, browse restaurant options, submit 1–5 ratings in a card-style interface, and get a “best match” recommendation based on overall compatibility across the group.

To try it:

Clone the repo, then:

npm install --legacy-peer-deps
